The aim of this project was to develop an expense tracker application. The application will automate the process of recording transactions, totaling expenses by category, and tracking progress towards saving goals. The goal is to aid the user in keeping an accurate record of their money inflow and outflow. This will be achieved by providing a program which will allow users to input and delete their monthly income and expenses. The app will automatically update the balance based on transactions and total the expenses by category. These results will then be stored for the user. The user interface will provide the current balance, expense amount, savings, and transactions. 

I followed an extensive tutorial on Cyce Truly and The Dumbfounds channels. I noted these as well in my SRS document.
